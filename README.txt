Hello!  This folder is full of examples of teaching materials I have used over the last few years.  Below is a short description of what you will find:


- Assignments:
	A selection of assignments from three classes: one on algorithm design and analysis, one on the theory of computation, and one on network science.


- Code:
	A few Python files filled with the code used in relevant assignments.  Students were given some starter code to use as a framework, and were then instructed to fill in the missing pieces by implementing the relevant algorithms themselves.


- PapersAndPosters:
	My published papers, as well as any relevant posters that were used in conjunction with them.


- Presentations:
	A collection of PowerPoint presentations I have used in the past.  Topics include: sustainability in the energy market, the economic operation of energy markets, natural abundance correction for isotope-labeled organic samples (as well as a short tutorial on how to execute this in my own software), reinforcement learning, and regression analysis.


I tried to put together a broad sampling of my work.  For instance, some of the presentations were meant as tutorials, some were meant to explore the details of a concept, and the energy sustainability presentation was for a talk I was invited to give which led to a guided group discussion of economic, ethical, and technical issues having to do with the energy sector.
